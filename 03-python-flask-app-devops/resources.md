In this article, we will explore how to integrate GitHub, Jenkins, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes to create an efficient and streamlined CI/CD pipeline. This setup allows us to automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying software, leading to faster and more reliable updates.
I had my code and created Dockerfile. After that, I built the Docker image, ran the container to make sure everything was working, and then pushed the image to Docker Hub. Next, I created Kubernetes manifests-specifically, deployment.yaml and service.yaml. In the deployment.yaml, I added the Docker image, and ArgoCD deployed the manifests to the Kubernetes cluster.
Later, I made some changes to my code. I had theDockerfile. Again, I built a new image, ran the container to make sure everything was working, and pushed the updated image to Docker Hub. After that, I changed the image tag in the deployment.yaml to use the new image version. ArgoCD detected the changes and automatically redeployed the updated version of my application.
Can I achieve automation?
Yes, Jenkins can automate this process.
I stored the credentials for DockerHub and GitHub in Jenkins to log in. Then, I set up a webhook between GitHub and Jenkins. Whenever a developer commits changes to the application, the webhook triggers a pipeline job in Jenkins. Jenkins automatically builds the new Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub. Afterward, Jenkins logs in to GitHub and updates the image tag in the deployment.yaml file. Finally, ArgoCD detects these changes and deploys the updated application to the Kubernetes.

In this lab, we have Jenkins, Docker, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes all running on one virtual machine.

In this project, Jenkins will take Code (from github), Build (build docker image and push to ECR), and Deploy (on Kubernetes).
About
We've stored credentials of dockerhub and github in Jenkins and also setup webhook b/w Github and Jenkins. When developer makes changes in application code, pipeline job gets triggered. Then Jenkins builds and pushes the image to dockerhub. After that, Jenkins logs github and updates the image tag in deployment.yaml, and finally, Argo
